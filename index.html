          In order to obtain your refund, contact customer service by phone
          and obtain an RMA (Return Merchandise Authorization) number to place
          on your package. Write this number on the outside of the shipping
          package, and send the product back to our fulfillment center at the
          address listed below, within thirty (30) days of the date you
          originally ordered the product. In order for your refund to be
          processed the product must arrive at our fulfillment facility within
          thirty (30) days of the original purchase date. You pay for return
          shipping. This fee will be taken out of the refund issued. Once our
          fulfillment center has received the package and relayed the correct
          information to us, you will be issued a refund. Your refund will be
          credited back to your bank account, and may take up to 3-5 business
          days to show in your statement, depending on the speed of the

          your refund, you must supply us with your name and delivery address.
          If you provide us with insufficient or incorrect information your
          refund will be delayed. Once a refund has been approved please allow
